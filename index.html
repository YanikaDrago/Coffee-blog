                    <p> Coffee is one of the most popular and beloved beverages in the world.
                        <br/>With its rich aroma and bold flavor, it's no wonder that people from all walks of life 
                        start their day with a hot cup of coffee. 
                    </p>   
                    <p>At its core, coffee is a simple beverage made by brewing ground coffee beans with hot water. 
                        But the art of coffee making has evolved over the years, with different brewing methods and 
                        roasting techniques yielding a wide variety of flavors and aromas. From light, floral brews 
                        to dark, smoky roasts, there's a coffee out there to suit every taste preference.
                     </p>   
                    <p>But coffee is more than just a beverage â€“ it's a cultural phenomenon. Coffee shops and cafes 
                        have become a hub for socializing, working, and relaxing, with many people enjoying a cup of 
                        coffee as a daily ritual. And with the rise of specialty coffee shops and third-wave coffee 
                        culture, the world of coffee has never been more diverse or exciting.
                    </p>   
                    <p>So whether you're a coffee aficionado or just someone who enjoys a good cup of joe, there's 
                        something special about this beloved beverage. From its humble origins to its current status
                        as a global icon, coffee is a drink that has captured the hearts and taste buds of people 
                        around the world.

            <p class="heading-description">As a rule, coffee is distinguished by the color of roasting of coffee beans: light, medium and dark. 
                <br/>Each of these options is distinguished by the heat treatment process, 
                due to which this or that coffee acquires its own unique taste and aroma.
            </p>

                    Light roast: natural coffee taste
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The name speaks for itself: light roast coffee beans have a light color, which is obtained with 
                    a short heat treatment.
                    <br/> And due to the relatively low roasting temperature, the beans do not become
                    oily. This method of processing allows you to preserve the natural taste of coffee as much as possible.
                    That is why light roasted beans are traditionally used for tasting coffee and determining the flavor profile.
    
                    Taste: thin with slight sourness.

                <p>
                    Medium roast beans take a little longer to cook than light roasts, so their color is darker. But since the 
                    roasting temperature remains low, the oil layer on the grains still does not form. The natural taste of the
                    coffee is retained even at a medium roast, but additional aromas begin to unfold and the taste becomes more intense.

                    Taste: light sourness with pronounced aftertaste.

                <p>
                    Is it chocolate or coffee? Yes, due to prolonged roasting at high temperatures, coffee beans acquire a very dark color
                    and an oily layer. But the natural aroma of coffee is almost completely replaced by additional aromas that are revealed
                    during roasting. Dark roasting makes the body of the grain very dense, and the taste is rich. This coffee is perfect for
                    making espresso.
                    Taste: rich, tart.

            <img src="/image/main.png" alt="methods"/>
            <p class="heading-description">Before preparing coffee, it is worth learning about the main factors
                that affect its taste. This will help you better understand any brewing
                method and experiment with your mind. In total, we distinguish six such
                factors: coffee freshness, water quality, storage method, grinding quality,
                equipment cleanliness and scale accuracy.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>Coffee freshness</h3>
            <p>
                    To make delicious coffee, the beans must be freshly roasted.
    
                    <br/>After roasting, the coffee bouquet still continues to form. However, two weeks after roasting,
                    the quality of the coffee begins to decline - the coffee gradually fizzles out.
                    
                    <br/>After two months, and with each passing day, the taste becomes more even and less expressive,
                    and sometimes rancid, like old butter. 
                    
                    <br/>The aroma loses the characteristics of the country and
                    region of coffee bean growth. Coffee becomes tasteless.
                    
                    <br/>To prepare delicious coffee, you need to use the grain in the first two months after roasting
                     - during this period, coffee can be considered fresh.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>
                    Coffee is almost 99% water, so it is important that it is suitable for coffee.
    
                    <br/>For coffee, water with a balance of salts and minerals is suitable - water mineralization.
                    <br/>The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) recommends brewing coffee with water with a mineralization 
                    of 75 to 175 mg/L.
    
                    <br/>In addition to mineralization, it is important that the pH value is between 6.5 and 8.
    
                    <br/>To achieve ideal water characteristics with a filtration system, you need to go through two steps:
                    <br/>- clean it with a professional reverse osmosis filter to obtain distilled water,
                    <br/>- either mix in more mineralized water, or use remineralizing cartridges.
    
                    <br/>A sophisticated filtration system is not for everyone. And in such a situation, we recommend using bottled water.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Storage method</h3>
            <p>
                    The ideal packaging for coffee is an opaque tight bag with a degassing valve and a zip lock.
                    <br/>Such a bag protects the grain from sunlight and contact with air, while the degassing valve 
                    helps to remove carbon dioxide, and the zip lock allows you to open and close the bag many times.
                    The ideal shelf life for coffee is one to two weeks. Acceptable month.
                    <br/>If you need to keep coffee longer, you can put it in the freezer. The main thing is that there 
                    are no foreign odors.

                    <br/>There are subtleties. If the coffee is ground, it exhales many times faster: not in days, but in minutes.
                    <br/>Therefore, you need to grind coffee a few minutes before brewing, and you should not buy ground coffee in the store at all.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Grind quality</h3>
            <p>
                    Quality grinding should be uniform. If the size of coffee particles in one serving of grinding varies from very small to large, 
                    the taste of coffee is unpredictable.

                    <br/>Perfectly uniform grinding also does not exist, so it is important that the variation in particle size is as small as possible. 
                    Only in this case, the taste of the drink will be manageable and clean.

                    <br/>As a rule, good electric coffee grinders with grinding adjustment are not very cheap. If you are not ready for such expenses,
                    you can use manual burr grinders. 
                    <br/>Cheap electric coffee grinders that are sold in electronics stores should not be used because
                    they do not grind evenly.

                    <br/>There are subtleties. In addition to uniformity, the size of the grind is also important, but it is different for each method.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Equipment cleanliness</h3>
            <p>
                    A dirty coffee maker or coffee grinder will nullify all efforts. Dried essential oils or ground coffee left in the grinder channel and
                    into the serving will turn the coffee rancid. Even if these oils or ground coffee are just a little bit.

                    <br/>TIn good coffee shops, coffee grinders are cleaned daily, and coffee machines twice a day. Even if a person is not very knowledgeable 
                    about coffee, he will recognize coffee that is made on dirty equipment. In such a situation, adjusting the grind or changing the water
                    will not help - you just need to clean the equipment regularly.

                    <br/>TThe equipment is cleaned with water, brushes, brushes and special cleaning agents.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Use of scales</h3>
            <p>
                    Coffee requires maximum precision in preparation, and scales are one of the main tools that help with this. If you measure the dosage by eye,
                    the result will always be random. Scales help track relationships and accurately understand the reasons for bad or good coffee.

                    <br/>You need to weigh both the beans and the water when pouring if you are using the alternative method, and the espresso if you are using an espresso machine.
                    <br/>It is the scales that will help you accurately maintain the proportions of 60 grams per liter for an alternative and 17â€“20 grams for a double espresso.
